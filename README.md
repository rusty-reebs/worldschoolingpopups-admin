Objectives: Build an Express REST API with JSON web token (`JWT`) authentication. The `JWT` is passed as a header cookie from the client to the server. Only registered users may post and edit events. Posting and editing events is only available on the admin frontend, not the public-facing frontend at (https://worldschoolingpopups.com).  

### TIL Things I Learned
----

- how to develop an Express REST API with `jwt` authentication.
- how to pass a token in the http header.
- gained a stronger understanding of Node `req`, `res`, and `next`.
- how to use the React `useContext` hook.
- some of the most challenging parts about this project were figuring out how to use the CORS middleware and http headers!
